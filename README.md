Monocle is a large language model designed specifically for binary analysis search. Monocle can be provided with a binary and a search criteria (e.g., authentication code, vulnerable code, password strings, and more), and it will decompile the binary and use its in-built LLM to identify and score areas of the code that meet the criteria. 
* **üî¨ Binary Search:** Without any prior knowledge, Monocle will support in answering binary analysis questions related to the target.
* **ü§ñ Plain Text and Open-Ended Questions:** As Monocle is backed by an LLM, queries passed to it are written in plain text.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Ghidra Enabled:** Monocle uses Ghidra headless to enable decompilation of functions!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

## System Requirements
Monocle uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model, and where possible offloads processing to your system's GPU. It is recommended to run Monocle on a machine with a minimum of 16GB of RAM and a dedicated Nvidia GPU with at least 4GB of memory. **However,** it can run on lower spec machines, but will be significantly slower.

**Monocle has been tested on Windows 11; however, it should be compatible with Unix and other systems.**

## Dependencies
Monocle requires **Nvidia CUDA** which allows for greatly increased performance of the LLM. A [guide here](https://telin.ugent.be/telin-docs/windows/pytorch/) can be seen on how to set up CUDA.

Monocle requires [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to be installed and accessible. Additionally, ensure that `analyzeHeadless` is available in your environment. 

Python dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Monocle can then be installed using the `./setup.py` script as below:

```
./setup.py install
```

## Running

To utilize Monocle, follow the instructions below:

### Binary Search
Execute Monocle with the appropriate parameters to conduct binary search tasks.

```bash
python3 monocle.py --binary <path-to-binary> --find <component-to-find>
```
or
```
monocle --binary <path-to-binary> --find <component-to-find>
```
### Examples
Below is an example of using Monocle on the pure-authd x86 binary [found here](https://github.com/polaco1782/linux-static-binaries/blob/master/x86-i686/pure-authd) to search for authentication code.

scss
Copy code
python.exe /Monocle/monocle.py --binary "..\linux-static-binaries-master\linux-static-binaries-master\x86-i686\pure-authd" --find "authentication code"

# ü§ñ Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
Behind the scenes Monocle uses the ```Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2``` model from The Mistral AI Team - see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825). The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) is an instruct fine-tuned version of the Mistral-7B-v0.2. More can be found on the model [here!](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2).
- 7.24B params
- Tensor type: BF16
- 32k context window (vs 8k context in v0.1)
- Rope-theta = 1e6
- No Sliding-Window Attention
